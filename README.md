RPubs (published knitted html) can be found here.

Getting started
If you are participating in the workshop, you may either (a) work on the ggplot-workshop-TEMPLATE.Rmd, which leaves space for participants to type code with instruction, or (b) follow along along in the ggplot-workshop-KEY.Rmd, which has all of the information and code we will be working with. Download the ggplot-workshop-KEY.html for a knitted (and much easier to read) version of the KEY.

Outline
Reminder: How do we use the tidyverse?
Useful functions to know for data wrangling, subsetting, manipulating, and summarising data
